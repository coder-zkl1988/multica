# Repository Guidelines

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working with code in this repository.

> **Single source of truth:** This file is a concise pointer document.
> All authoritative architecture, coding rules, and conventions
> live in **CLAUDE.md** at the project root. Read that file first.
> Use `Makefile`, `package.json`, and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` as the
> source of truth for the full command list.

## Quick Reference

### Architecture

Go backend + monorepo frontend (pnpm workspaces + Turborepo) with shared packages.

- `server/` - Go backend (Chi router, sqlc, gorilla/websocket)
- `apps/web/` - Next.js frontend (App Router)
- `apps/desktop/` - Electron desktop app
- `apps/mobile/` - Expo / React Native iOS app (read `apps/mobile/CLAUDE.md` first)
- `apps/docs/` - Fumadocs documentation site
- `packages/core/` - Headless business logic (Zustand stores, React Query hooks, API client)
- `packages/ui/` - Atomic UI components (shadcn/Base UI, zero business logic)
- `packages/views/` - Shared business pages/components
- `packages/tsconfig/` - Shared TypeScript config
- `packages/eslint-config/` - Shared ESLint config

### State Management (critical)

- **React Query** owns all server state (issues, members, agents, inbox, workspace list)
- **Zustand** owns client/view state (view filters, drafts, modals, desktop tab state); current workspace identity is route-driven and only mirrored for platform plumbing
- All Zustand stores live in `packages/core/` - never in `packages/views/` or app directories
- WS events update React Query for server data; store writes are only for clearing client-owned pointers with a single responder/self-event guard

### Package Boundaries (hard rules)

- `packages/core/` - zero react-dom, zero localStorage, zero process.env
- `packages/ui/` - zero `@multica/core` imports
- `packages/views/` - zero `next/*`, zero `react-router-dom`, use `NavigationAdapter` for routing
- `apps/web/platform/` - only place for Next.js APIs

### Database Migrations (hard rules)

- Never add database foreign keys or cascading actions. Enforce relationships and perform dependent cleanup explicitly in the application layer, using transactions when the operation must be atomic.
- Every index created by a migration, including unique indexes and indexes on new tables, must use `CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX CONCURRENTLY`. Keep each concurrent index build in its own single-statement migration file.

### Commands

```bash
make dev              # Auto-setup + start everything
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript check
pnpm test             # TS unit tests (Vitest)
make test             # Go tests
make check            # Full verification pipeline
```

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **multica** (46487 symbols, 139820 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
