/**
 * View store for the workspace-wide Issues view in the Tasks tab.
 *
 * Shape mirrors `useMyIssuesViewStore` plus a `scope` field — workspace
 * Issues has `all / members / agents` scope tabs (see web
 * `packages/views/issues/components/issues-page.tsx:32-94`), while
 * My Issues has its own `assigned / created / agents` scopes.
 *
 * The `scope` filter is **client-side** on `assignee_type` — see
 * `all-issues-view.tsx`'s `scopedIssues` derivation. Server param stays unset
 * so the cache key (`issueKeys.list(wsId)`) and WS realtime invalidation
 * (`useIssuesRealtime`) don't have to know about scope.
 *
 * `IssuesScope` is defined locally rather than imported from
 * `@multica/core/issues/stores/issues-scope-store` — mobile only
 * `import type` from `@multica/core/types/*` per Sharing Principles, and
 * the union is small enough that a duplicated literal is preferable to a
 * cross-package type import hop.
 *
 * Empty filter array = "show all" (matches web's predicate semantics in
 * packages/views/issues/utils/filter.ts).
 *
 * No persist middleware — filters are session-scoped. `clearFilters`
 * deliberately does NOT reset `scope` so a workspace switch keeps the
 * user on the same scope tab (web's URL-driven scope reset is incidental
 * to its routing model, not an invariant mobile should mirror).
